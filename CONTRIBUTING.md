# Contributing to building-mobile-apps-flex

This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the building-mobile-apps-flex source code.

The building-mobile-apps-flex repo is a collection of samples and documentation that was originally assembled by Lloyd Heberlie and Andy Gup. We are excited that you are interested in improving the building-mobile-apps-flex source code. This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [building-mobile-apps-flex](../../) repo on GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine.
4. Checkout the [develop branch](../../tree/develop).
5. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.
    * The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "fix-splitview-navigator".
6. Write code to add an enhancement or fix the problem.  
    * Follow the coding conventions already used in the building-mobile-apps-flex source code (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [Flex Formatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/files/) along with our [Flex Formatter settings](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties)).
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.
    * Use [clear and descriptive commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Test your code.
